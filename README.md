## Getting Started

I highly recommend using v2.x, even though it is still in preview, it is 1000% times better than v1.x.

### Contributing

Currently, this bot is under going a complete re-write in the [v2 branch](https://github.com/Voltstro/Pootis-Bot/tree/v2). This will mean that once v2 is out, support for v1.x will not be given anymore, however any fixes (such as Discord.Net updates) that are required will be given to v1.x while v2 is in the works.

Any PRs that include major new features will not be accepted!

## Quick Notes

- This is the first piece of software that I have publicly released, there are bound to be mistakes and pieces of code that aren't "professional" or whatever you want to say.
- The name 'Pootis-Bot' was suggested by my friend. Yes, I know what game it is from, I play it!
- The robot heavy icon is Valve Corporationâ€™s model.
- Thanks for Discord for generally being awesome (most of the time).
