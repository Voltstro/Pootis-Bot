Pootis-Bot, a multipurpose, modular, open-source Discord bot written in the C# language using [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net).

# Bot Features

**NOTE**: The current V2.x re-write is lacking a lot of the features that 1.x had. Once the 2.x re-write is complete it should offer the same and even more functionality as 1.x.

- Multi Server Capabilities
- Moderation
- User Accounts
- Leveling system
- Music Service (Downloads from YouTube)
- Google, YouTube, Giphy, Wikipedia and Steam user search support
- Rule reaction feature
- Auto Voice Channels
- Basic Anti-Spam features
- Cross-Platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS)

## Getting Started

**I will not host the bot for you! You will need to host it your self to have it on your own Discord server!** Read about hosting [here](https://pootis-bot.voltstro.dev/hosting/).

Currently, this bot is under going a complete re-write. This will mean that once v2 is out, support for v1.x will not be given anymore, however any major fixes (such as Discord.Net updates) that are required will be given to v1.x while v2 is in the works. Any PRs that include major new features will not be accepted!

V2 will include major breaking changes (as its a re-write), but will make the bot, and its code 1000 times better.

## Quick Notes

* This is the first piece of software that I have publicly released, there are bound to be mistakes and pieces of code that aren't "professional" or whatever you want to say.
* The name 'Pootis-Bot' was suggested by my friend. Yes, I know what game it is from, I play it!
* The robot heavy icon is Valve Corporation’s model.
* Thanks for Discord for generally being awesome (most of the time).
